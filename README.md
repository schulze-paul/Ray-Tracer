![Preview image](https://github.com/schulze-paul/ray-tracer/blob/main/images/image_800_steady.png?raw=true)

Inspired by Peter Shirley's book series about Ray Tracing.

## Captures a variety of physical optical effects:

- Fresnel reflection
- Refraction based on Snell's law
- Diffuse scattering
- Motion blur
- Soft shadows
- Depth of field
